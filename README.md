## Dataset Info :
### DAWN (Detection in Adverse Weather Nature)
The DAWN dataset comprises a collection of 1000 images from real-traffic environments, which are divided into four sets of weather conditions: fog, snow, rain and sandstorms.  
-Link: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/766ygrbt8y/3
- We modified the mistakes we found in the annotated files for each image and split the dataset into 75% train,15% val,10% test
- 
## Proposed Model for Object Detection in Hazardous Environment 
- We train the YoloV5s detector on the our dataset to detect and locate the object in image.
